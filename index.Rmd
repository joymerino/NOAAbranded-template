# Level 1

The file `_site.yml` specifies the look and nav bar structure. A footer can be added to that file in which case the same footer is added to each page. If you don't want that, then you can delete the `footer.html` bit in `_site.yml` and instead add this code at the end of each Rmd file.

    `â€‹``{r child="footerrmd.Rmd"}
    ```

## Level 2

Some information and a link. <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r child="disclaimer.Rmd"}
```
